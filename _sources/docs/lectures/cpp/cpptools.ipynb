    "# C++ tips and tricks\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is certainly possible to write bug-free C++ in a pure text editor without any tool to guide you, most professional developers heavily on tools to help them write, compile and debug the code they are writing. In this document we will go through a few tips and tricks that will help you when developing C++ code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## C++ extension for your editor\n",
    "Most of the modern editors, or integrated development environments (IDEs) comes the possibility of using extensions. For example in Visual Studio Code you have the [C++ extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/introvideos-cpp) that will give you tab completion, documentation and much more. Spending some time on learning how to use these extension will definitely pay off in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging\n",
    "Very often your editor or compiler will point out mistakes you have made in the code, but sometimes the code compiles fine even though it contain bugs. For example if you get the following cryptic message when you try to run your program, you know there is something wrong.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Segmentation fault (core dumped)\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is good practice to compile and run your code often so that you have a better feeling on when the bug was introduced. However, sometimes it can be tricky to know what is causing your program to fail, and in this case it might be a good solution to reach for a debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging with `gdb` or `lldb`\n",
    "The standard debugger for `GNU` is called `gdb`, while the debugger for `clang` is called `lldb`. The interface of the two are similar and we will therefore show the commands using `gdb`, but if you are on a Mac and use `clang` then you can try swapping `gdb` with `lldb` and it should work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a debugger is an alternative of putting print statements all over your code. A debugger lets you inspect the code in more detail and help you track down the cause of failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will try debugging the following program which we will call `nullptr_deref.cpp`\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "#include <iostream>\n",
    "\n",
    "void my_function()\n",

    "```\n",
    "$ ./nullptr_deref\n",
    "Segmentation fault (core dumped)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now we will try to run the program using the debugger. Before using the debugger we should compile our program with debugging information. We can do this by sending in the `-g` flag to the compiler\n",

    "c++ nullptr_deref.cpp -o nullptr_deref -g\n",

    "Memory leaks can be difficult to spot, and often you these bug will go unnoticed until they suddenly become a big problem. Fortunately, there are tools that can help you track down memory leaks.

    "\n",
    "In C++, there is a distinction between *declaration* and *definition*. A function declaration specifies the function's signature, i.e its name and the types of its arguments and the return value. The signature of the `bubble_sort` function for example is\n",

    "Note that we excluded the name of the argument to the function (i.e `numbers`) because it is not important in the signature.\n",
    "This distinction becomes important when working with multiple files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition on the other hand refers to the actual implementation. In order to use function it has to be declared first. We can illustrate this with a single file as well. The following code will not compile\n",

    "Notice the distinction between including a library from the standard library e.g `iostream` and this file. For the standard library (and any order installed library) you can use the angle brackets e.g `<iostream>`.

    "Before moving along we need to talk about the two steps needed to go from a source file (i.e the code we write in the file ending with a `.cpp`) to an executable file (typically a `.out` file or a `.exe` file).

    "Now that we have included `sort.hpp` in `test_sort.cpp` the compiler sees that the function `bubble_sort` function is declared. However, during the compilation step, the compiler does not need to know the definition (or implementation) of `bubble_sort`. It is sufficient that it knows the signature. The definition is needed during the linking step, and since `sort.cpp` also includes `sort.hpp`, the linker will figure out the definition of `bubble_sort` is found in `sort.cpp`.\n",

    "## Makefile - managing the compilation and linking\n",
    "\n",
    "The compilation and linking process can be quite tedious when many files are involved, and typing out all the commands are both time consuming and error prone. Tools like [`GNU make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) can help you automate this process.  `GNU make` is typically already installed if you are using MacOSX or Linux. If you are on Windows, you can consult the [following stack overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32127524/how-to-install-and-use-make-in-windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that you create a file called `Makefile` (with no extension) and inside this you create so called rules which has the following structure\n",

    "\n",
    "Even though `Makefile` definitely make the process of compiling and linking easier, modern C++ projects often contains many files and many dependencies that can be difficult to compile. This leads us to a modern version of `make` called [CMake](https://cmake.org).\n",

    "CMake allows you to define how to compile your program at a higher abstraction level and therefore it works very well with different compilers and different operating systems.

The final lines specifies the name of the executable and lists the relevant source files.\n",

The `EXTRACT_ALL` configuration will create documentation for all files even though it cannot find any documentation. This is useful if only parts of your code is documented. We also set `HAVE_DOT` to `YES`. When setting this to `YES` doxygen will create a dependency graphs that shows how your files are related. However, it also requires another package called [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/). Finally we set the `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` to `docs` which means that the files that are generated from doxygen wil be put in a new folder called `docs`.\n",
