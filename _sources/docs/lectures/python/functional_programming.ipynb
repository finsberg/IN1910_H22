    "Many programming languages are considered either object-oriented or functional. However, in python we can use both paradigms. Knowing a little bit about both object-oriented programming and functional programming will make you a better programmer in general because you will have a larger arsenal of tools in your toolbox. We will not argue that one paradigm is better than the other. It is a matter of preference.\n",

    "y = square(x)\n",

    "\n",
    "What would be an example of a non-pure function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Any function that depends on the state of the program will not be a pure function. Instance methods on a class are typically not pure (but they can be). Here is a simple example of a function that is not pure\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def compute_age_this_year_unpure(year_born):\n",
    "    return datetime.datetime.now().year - year_born\n",
    "```\n",
    "If we compute the following\n",
    "```python\n",
    "year_born = 1999\n",
    "y = compute_age_this_year_unpure(year_born)\n",
    "z = compute_age_this_year_unpure(year_born)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Will `y` and `z` be equal? Well, in most cases they will, but if you happen to run this program at new years eve then you might be unlucky. Can we make this function pure? Of course, we just have to pass in the year today as an argument\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def compute_age_this_year_pure(year_born, year_today):\n",
    "    return year_today - year_born\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "y = compute_age_this_year_pure(year_born, year_today)\n",
    "z = compute_age_this_year_pure(year_born, year_today)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Will `y` and `z` be equal in this case? Yes!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are pure functions nice?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why we like pure functions. One reason is that they are much easier to test. If we want to test `compute_age_this_year_pure` it would be fairly straight forward, e.g\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_compute_age_this_year_pure():\n",
    "    assert compute_age_this_year_pure(2000, 2022) == 22\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing the unpure function is much more tricky. In fact you would need to apply a a rather advanced technique called [mocking](https://realpython.com/python-mock-library/) in order to do it, which is not covered in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another nice thing about pure functions is that since they are always returning the same value for a given argument we can use something called [*memoization*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) to increase the performance. The idea behind memoization is to store the argument and the returned value of the function in some storage and then when the function is called we check is the value is already computed, and if it is we return that. Otherwise we run the function and update the storage. We will look at this a bit later in this section after we have covered {ref}`python-scopes`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Names, Namespaces and Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "* We constantly define new names for variables, functions, classes, etc., and import numerous others from modules and packages.\n",
    "* It would be impossible to keep track of all the names that are used throughout a large program and all its imports.\n",
    "* Potential name conflicts are resolved using the concepts of *namespaces* and *scope*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python namespaces\n",
    "A *namespace* is simply a mapping from names to objects. Within a single namespace, names should uniquely define an object, but objects in different namespaces may have the same local name. A real-world analogy is license plate numbers for cars. In Norway, the license plate uniquely identifies a car, but if you go to Denmark a car can have exactly the same number combination. The two countries define different *namespaces*, and to uniquely identify a car you need to know *both the namespace and local name*. An example closer to the world of programming is a directory in a file system. Each directory defines a local namespace, so two files having identical names but stored in different directories are uniquely identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, namespaces are created dynamically as objects are created. A namespace containing all the builtin Python names is created when Python starts, and is never deleted. Similarly, all variables created in the top level script exist in the global namespace (`__main__`), and each module has its own global namespace, which also normally exist until Python ends. A class definition creates a new namespace local to that class. Since a class definition is usually not deleted, this namespace also exists until we end Python. On the other hand, every time we create an instance of the class we create a new local namespace, which is deleted when the object is deleted, and when a function is called it creates a new local namespace, which exists until the function is done executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We access names in different namespaces using the standard *dot* notation, as in `math.exp`, `numpy.array`, `Sphere.from_volume`, `p.Name`, etc. If we don't use the dot notation to specify which namespace a variable name belongs to, Python will search for the name according to a predefined set of rules, starting with the local namespace and moving up the hierarchy of more \"global\" namespaces. See the discussion of scope below for a more precise definition.\n",

The magic happens when the `throw_fun` function returns a `height` function (note that the function itself is returned, not the result of the function call). Now, the returned function will remember the namespace defined by the outer function, even after `throw_fun` is done executing and the namespace is therefore deleted. This namespace is locked to the function object `throw2` and even if we create a new global `v0` variable all calls to `throw2` will use the value 5.0.\n",
