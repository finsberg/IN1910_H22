    "# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will start looking at object-oriented programming (OOP). This is one of the major components of IN1910. In this lecture we will start to look at what OOP is, and how to program object-oriented in Python. In later lectures we will cover some more theory of object-oriented programming and also touch on it in C++.\n",

    "## What is Object-Oriented Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP for short), is a [*programming paradigm*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm). Put simply, a paradigm is a way to think about, organize, and write code. Paradigms are used to classify and describe languages and programming styles. Many other paradigms exists, and you might have heard of some of them. Some examples are: procedural programming, functional programming, imperative programming, and symbolic programming. Most programming languages don't belong to a single, specific paradigm. Instead most languages, including Python and C++, are described as *multi-paradigm*, meaning it is possible to structure and write your code in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is a way of solving problems, or building software, by defining data as *objects*, and specifying how those objects behave and interact. It is one of the most popular programming paradigms, and is often used when developing software. When done correctly, OOP leads to code that is usually quite easy to understand, use and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The origins of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming was invented in Norway by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard in 1967. They made a new programming language, and called the first object-oriented language *Simula*. While Simula was revolutionary and historically an important language, it didn't see widespread adoption. Inspired by Simula, the language *Smalltalk* came on the scene in 1972 and saw a wider use, pushing the use of OOP. Smalltalk still sees some use today, mainly as a means of teaching OOP and introductory programming. In 1983 *C++* arrived on the scene, and can be described as the first \"industrial\" object-oriented language. C++ was invented by Bjarne Stroustrup. He thought Simula had some nice features for large software development, but considered it to be to slow to be practical. He therefore started developing *\"C with classes\"*, which would eventually become C++.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are *objects*? You probably already have some intuition around what objects are. In Python, all variables are objects. So in a sense an object is similar to a variable. All objects have a few characteristics we can associate with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All objects have a given object *type*. We for example have integers, strings, lists and dictionaries. Objects of these types will behave differently, but they are all examples of objects\n",
    "2. Objects behave in certain pre-defined ways. We can for example perform calculations with numbers, we can sort lists, or we can split a string. The type defines what actions we can perform, and what we can't do. It wouldn't make sense to divide a list by another list for example\n",
    "3. Objects typically have information or data stored in them. For integers and floats this would be their numerical value, for a list it is all the elements and so on. In certain cases however, we define empty lists/dictionaries and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons OOP is so popular is that it is quite intuitive, because it mirrors real life. To make sense of the world around us when we think or talk we tend to divide everything into specific concepts or *objects*. Cars are objects and so are buildings. People are objects too, in the software sense. It isn't only physical things that are objects either. A given calendar date is an object, defined by its day, month and year. This course is IN1910, which could be described as an abstract object. We can think of a job as an object. In this sense an object is a data abstraction that attempts to capture some important property or feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Everything in Python are objects**. When you are programming in Python, you are defining and using objects all the time. Does this mean you are programming object-oriented? Not necessarily. As we mentioned in the introduction the important thing is *thinking* and *solving problems* in an object-oriented manner. Meaning to do OOP properly one should ask what kind of objects are best for organizing a program and solving problems. Probably the most important task of programming object-oriented is therefore to define new data types, and defining how objects of that type should be represented and interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: A contact list\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the contact list on your phone. For each contact, you can store information of different types: name, different phone numbers, emails, etc. For some contacts you have many pieces of information about, some you only have a single piece of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us say we want to implement such a contact list for a new phone system we are making. We might start thinking how to solve this problem. It makes sense to think of each individual contact as an individual *object*. Each piece of information belongs to a given contact, so it should be part of that object in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, we only want to store information about each contact, and so dictionaries would be a natural choice for this. We can use key-value pairs to store the information we want, and ignore the pieces of information we don't want. Other parts of the software system can then go in and access information from the contact dictionary as needed"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class vs Instance\n",
    "\n",
    "When we define a class, we are defining a new data type. To actually use it, we have to define a new object of that type, we call this an *instance* of the class. In our contact-list example, the `Contact` class is the general class we defined, then we can implement specific instances of the class, one for \"Lisa\", one for \"Frank\" and so on. The class is thus the abstract *concept* of a contact, and objects are the specific cases of that type. A different example: A Nissan leaf is a given type of car, and can be represented as a class. A specific car with the license plate \"EM93277\" (courtesy of random.org) is an *instance* of the Nissan leaf class. The specific car is an object of the *type* Nissan leaf. In this sense, the class is like the blue-print, it specifies how objects of that type should be built and how they should behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/?#class-names) style-guide class names should use the CapWords convention (aka PascalCase). This means every word in the class name should be capitalized, and the words should **not** be separated by underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples: `Person`, `Polynomial`, `Vector3D`, `BankAccount`, `FileReader`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific instances of a class however, should always be lowercase. So when we define a variable of a given class, we would write for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "u = Vector3D()\n",
    "poly = Polynomial()\n",
    "acc9302100 = BankAccount()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be strict about this rule, as it makes it much easier to differentiate the *classes* themselves (the general datatype) from instances of that class (the specific objects) in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: A deck of cards\n",
    "\n",
    "Time for another example. Let us say we are implementing some card games. Now, we can easily represent a deck of cards using lists of strings in Python, no problem. However, for most card games, we need to use the exact same operations: get a new deck, shuffle the deck, draw cards, etc. It would be useful to implement the code to do this one time, and then just use that functionality each time we implement a new card game.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this by implementing a `Deck` class. After having implemented our class, we can then define an instance of this class (`deck = Deck()`). Our actual game code will then be much simpler, because we can now simply call `deck.shuffle()` or `deck.draw(5)` and so on. This adds a layer of abstraction to our code, and hides away the ugly implementation details \"behind the scenes\". This is called *encapsulation*, and is one of the motivations for using OOP. We can say we hide the implementation, but expose an easy-to-use and easy-to-understand *interface* that is used to manipulate the object"

We also add a `shuffle` method that shuffles the deck, a `draw` method that draws $n$ cards from the deck, and a `shuffle_into_deck` for when we want to shuffle cards back into the deck. These are just simple examples of functionality that makes sense for a deck of cards, and we could add plenty more.\n",

    "### The use of `self`\n",
    "\n",
    "In our class examples so far, we have simply used the `self`-syntax without explaining it. It is a normal point of confusion for those learning Python, and even those who learn how to define the classes and method using `self` might not really understand *why* it works like it does.\n",

    "This is interpreted behind the scenes by Python as\n",
    "```\n",
    "Deck.shuffle(deck)\n",
    "```\n",
    "And so the method `Deck.shuffle`, even though it is written inside the class, actually just acts like a stand-alone function, the object is simply passed in and manipulated. And so when we define the function we call the first input-argument `self`, because this is the *object itself* (in this case `self = deck`). Note that you can, technically, call this argument something other than `self`, it is just a function argument, like any other. However, it is considered good code style to always use `self` and it will be confusing for others if you use something else. (Most languages use either \"self\" or \"this\".)\n",
    "\n",
    "So for most class methods you define, you both define the method with `self` as the first argument. And you use `self` inside the method to manipulate the data within the object. Let us look back at the `Deck.shuffle` method:"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "In our deck of cards example, we have specific methods the user can use to interact with the deck of cards, and we can call this the *interface* (På norsk: grensesnitt) of the class. To put it simply, the interface is what is \"visible\" or usable from outside the class. If you build a large and complex class, all anyone really needs to interact with it is a good understanding of its interface. In this sense, the interface itself is an abstraction tool. Take a car for example, the interface used for driving that gar is the steering wheel, the pedals and the gear stick. However, under the hood there is an engine and lots of complicated machinery.\n",
    "\n",
    "The act of hiding dirty implementation or technical details under the hood is called *encapsulation*. Encapsulation is useful for keeping code nice and tidy and user friendly. Also, it means that the details under the hood can change without issue, as long as the external interface remains the same. A mechanic can replace the engine in your car, but you will still be able to drive it as before, because the interface is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some languages, like Java and C++, you can explicitly define interfaces that define what a class must contain.  These are often described as \"contracts\", as they state what a given class that follows that interface must contain.\n",

    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that we can use callable objects as if they were functions is very useful in Python, and it is an example of [*polymorphism*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)). Polymorphism is another of the pillars of OOP, but the concept is a bit tricky to define or understand. The term itself comes from greek and means \"many forms\". It is a means of generalizing code, in that we can write different code that behaves the same under given circumstances, and thus we can use those objects as long as they have a given property we need. In this case, we can create objects that acts and feels like functions, and we can use them for any purpose were we need a Python function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of Python's [*duck typing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing). This term comes from the saying:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.*\n",
    "\n",
    "What we mean by this is that what *type* a given object is isn't that important, what is important is how it behaves. In Python we therefore shouldn't check whether a given input is a Python function, instead we should check whether it is *callable*. This can be done with the built-in function:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "callable(f)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This function returns `True` if the object `f` is callable, and `False` if it is not. It doesn't care whether `f` is a Python function, a custom class or a given class method. It only cares if `f` quacks like a duck.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: The derivative class\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, Newton's method is a numerical method for finding the roots of a mathematical function (a root is the point where the function is equal to zero). Normally to use Newtons method you need the function itself ($f(x)$), it's derivative ,$\\frac{\\rm d}{{\\rm d}x} f(x)$. which also is a function, and an initial guess $x_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now assume we are given a function `newton(f, x0, dfdx)` that implements Newton's method. The SciPy library for example has the function `scipy.optimize.newton(func, x0, dfdx)`. We want to use this function to find the roots of a function $f(x)$. However, we don't know the derivative $f'(x)$ that must be sent in, and we cannot find it analytically. What do we do?\n",

    "One solution would be to implement the derivative function numerically. We can approximate the derivative function in any point using the central finite difference for example,\n",

    "Typically we compute this for a given array of values or something like that. However, for `newton` to work, we can't send in an array of values, we must send in a callable function.

And again if that doesn't work, for example if you need to do something more advanced in the initializer, then you might be better of just using a regular class.
