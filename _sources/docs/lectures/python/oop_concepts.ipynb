    "# Designing Object-Oriented Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will go more into the theoretical basis of object-oriented programming and cover more of the concepts and ideas used in designing object-orient code.\n",

    "## The four pillars of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"four pillars\" are four concepts that are central when designing object-oriented programs. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Abstraction**; to extract the essential features of objects we use into a common abstract concept (i.e. a class)\n",
    "* **Encapsulation**; collecting all the data and functionality into a single class, that is accessed through a well-defined interface.\n",
    "* **Inheritance**; defining new classes based on existing classes.\n",
    "* **Polymorphism**; the idea that an object or a function can have different behavior based on the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction means to extract the essential features of objects we use into a common abstract concept (i.e. a class). As part of the abstraction we also decouple how something is used from how it is implemented, and only need to focus on the implementation when developing the class. We can hide away unnecessary or complex details when using the class, exposing only a clean interface externally. Abstraction reduces overall code complexity and makes code easier to understand. Abstraction is essential in modern software systems, since it would be impossible to deal with the complexity of modern systems while still keeping track of all details down to the level of single bits. For instance, we work with integers and floating point numbers as abstract quantities without knowing how these are represented on the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation means collecting all the data and functionality into a single class. The concept of encapsulation is related to and to some extent overlapping with abstraction, in that we \"encapsulate\" details inside a class, exposing only the easy-to-use interface. Encapsulation also encompasses hiding data inside classes that the external user never interacts with directly or sees. An essential goal of proper encapsulation is that internal data structures of a class may be completely changed, but as long as the interface is untouched all code using the class will still work.\n",
    "We use floating point numbers continuously in our codes, but only through the defined Python operators, never\n",
    "manipulating the actual number representation in memory. Therefore, our codes still work even if the standard for floating point number representation is changed (which has happened several times through history).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance means defining new classes based on existing classes. Inheritance is useful because it lets us avoid re-implementing the same methods and behaviors many times (don't repeat yourself), but also because it creates a clear *hierarchy* in your classes, which can be used to structure code. Inheritance can be seen as a central tool for *abstraction*, since the class hierarchies will (should) often map to natural hierarchical relations between different concepts. Consider an example from daily life; in most contexts it is sufficient to think of a car simply as a car, without knowing the brand, model, type, etc, while for other applications more details are needed. The same is true in many programming applications, and inheritance provides the tools for handling these relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is perhaps the most tricky concept, but it means that an object can have different behavior based on context. A blu-ray player can read both a blu-ray disc and a DVD, on a technical level, these are very different, but for the user, they are added to the player and functions the same. This would be an example of polymorphic behavior. Similarly, we can for example define a method that can take input of different types, for example an integer *or* a list of integers. The concept of polymorphism is tightly coupled to the use of inheritance and class hierarchies, in *statically typed languages*, where input arguments to a function are required to be of a specific type. With the dynamic typing in Python, polymorphic behavior can also be achieved with other methods, but using class hierarchies and OOP often leads to better structured and more readable code. By making polymorphic classes, we can generalize our classes so they can be easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, the *four pillars* are closely related and partly overlapping concepts. For instance, polymorphism is typically implemented through inheritance, and inheritance is also a key tool for abstractions that have a natural hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A simple example to illustrate the four pillars\n",
    "\n",
    "A general problem when introducing OOP is that the ideas are most useful for large programs. For simple example codes, that are practical to use in courses, the benefit of OOP is typically rather small. Seeing the real value of OOP therefore requires some ability to extrapolate, and try to imagine how code designs and implementations will scale to systems with 1000s of code lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simple examples to illustrate the four pillars. You have probably seen similar examples previously, but we repeat it here to link it directly to the four pillars. Say we have a program that uses matrices, vectors, and matrix-vector products. Vectors and matrices are conveniently stored as numpy arrays:"

While this is clearly not the only way this could be implemented, multiple inheritance in this case provides a logical and well-structured hierarchy, which also maximizes code reuse.\n",
