    "There are several advantages to implementing these quadratic functions as actual Quadratic-objects, rather than as normal Python functions. For one, they now have a custom type, which we can check using `isinstance(f, Quadratic)`. Thus, other parts of our code can *know* that the function is a quadratic function. We can also extend the class adding plenty of useful functionality. We could for example add functionality for adding or subtracting functions, producing new Quadratic-objects. This cannot be done with normal functions. Or we could add a method for returning the derivative. If you do this week's exercises, you will get the chance to implement all of these for a general degree polynomial.\n",

    "\n",
    "However, it is possible to create variables that belong to the *class*, and not specific objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three common uses of class variables and class methods are:\n",
    "* To keep track of the number of objects created of a class\n",
    "* To store global parameters, that should be the same for all instances\n",
    "* So-called 'factory methods', which creates new objects in different ways than what is commonly done in the constructor\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first example, we simply keep a counter running that increases every time we create a new object of the class:"

    "### Class Methods vs Static Methods (1)\n",
    "Static methods and class methods appear to be quite similar. The difference can be understood by considering the Python concept of *bound methods*:\n",
    "* An ordinary function in Python is often called an unbound function, because it is not bound to a particular class or object.\n",
    "* On the other hand, a regular instance method defined in a class becomes *bound to an instance* every time a new instance of the class is generated. In fact, when we create a new instance, we also create a new function object, which is bound to that instance and thereby becomes a bound method. Each instance has its own method object. The most important effect of this binding is that the instance is automatically passed as the first argument to the method (`self`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Methods vs Static Methods (2)\n",
    "* Using the `@classmethod` decorator simply tells Python that this function should be bound to the class and not the instance. No matter how many instances we create, there will only exist one method object, and when we call it the class (`cls`), and not the instance, is automatically passed as the first argument. The method can still be accessed through a specific instance, but it still remains bound to the class and the class is passed as the first argument.\n",
    "* Finally, when we use the `@staticmethod` decorator, we tell Python that this function should not be bound to either the class or the instance, but remain an unbound function. It is still defined within the *namespace* of the class, and can be accessed either through the class or through a specific instance (as for `calculate_age` above), but it remains an unbound Python function and no arguments get passed automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Methods vs Static Methods (3)\n",
    "These differences lead to the following \"rules\" for when to use the different methods:\n",
    " * Use a regular instance method if it needs access to instance data. This is by far the most common use case in OOP.\n",
    " * If the method does not need access to instance data, but it does access class data, define it as a class method.\n",
    " * Finally, if the method logically belongs to the class, but does not operate on either\n",
    " instance data or class data (i.e. neither `self`, `cls`, or the class name appear inside the function body) it should be a static method.\n",

    "Mathematically speaking, it is much more common to write $3u$ than $u\\cdot 3$, and so saying we should just write `u*3` in our code is not satisfactory. So what can we do? It turns out this problem is so common that Python has a built-in work around in the form of the special method called `__rmul__` (for right multiply). This method is called automatically if the first operands `__mul__` throws an error. So if we implement `__rmul__` we get the following cascade\n",

    "\n",
    "Here are some that might be of special interest:\n",
    "* `__eq__`, for defining when two objects should be considered equal (What does `a == b` mean?).\n",
    "* You can also define `__lt__` (less than, $<$), `le` (less or equal, $\\le$) and so on. If you implement all the six comparison operators it is typically called *rich comparisons* and it will make your objects automatically sortable with `sort()`.\n",
    "* `__bool__` defines what `if x:` means for our object\n",
    "* `__abs__` defines what `abs(x)` means\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can also implement `lt`, `le`, `gt`, `ge`, `ne` for $\\lt, \\le, \\gt, \\ge, \\ne$. Implementing all of these is called *rich comparisons*, and automatically makes our objects sortable with `sort()`\n",
    "* `__bool__` defines what `if x:` means for our object\n",
    "* `__abs__`, defines what `abs(x)` means. For `Vector3D` we could for example define it so that `abs(u)` returns `u.length`.\n",
    "* `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` can be used to make our object indexable, i.e., define what `x[0]`, `x[1]` and so on means\n",
    "* (**Advanced**) `__hash__` makes it possible to compute a [hash value](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/hash) from your object with `hash(u)`. This is needed if you want to use your object as a key in a dictionary.\n",

    "## Short introduction to inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last portion of this section, we will give a very brief introduction to *inheritance*, which we will come back to in more detail in {ref}`designing-oop-programs`. For now we will just one simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a term we use to describe how we can use one class to build another. In Python we let a class inherit from another when we define it. When we do this, the *parent* class gives its functionality, i.e., all its attributes to the newly created class, typically called the *daughter* class. Instead of saying parent/child, one can also say superclass and subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create a class through inheritance we start with a class that has all the attributes of its parent, but we can extend this by implementing new methods to add on, or we can overwrite existing methods to change how they work. In general we make a subclass to specialize a class. So the parent/superclass will be a more *general* case, while the subclass will be more specialized/specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us look at a somewhat silly example, taken from the mobile game Pokémon Go. If you've haven't played that game, the example is hopefully still easy to follow. Either way, the details about the specific calculations we implement are not the important point here, try to focus more about the big picture, and focus on how we implement the class and use inheritance in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "(pokemon-example)=\n",
    "### Example: Pokémon Go\n",
    "\n",
    "In the game Pokémon Go, the goal is for the players to catch different *Pokémons* (pocket monsters). Many different types of Pokémon exist, some common, some rare. Each Pokémon you catch have different stats and, at least in principle, players want to catch Pokémons with good stats, i.e., high numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you walk around, the game generates random Pokémon that can be found, and it also randomizes its stats. And we will now implement a code that replicates this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stats of a specific Pokémon is dependent on its species/type, because each species has specific base stats. In addition each individual Pokémon caught has a randomized bonus to its stat, called the *individual value*. These individual values are random numbers between 0 and 15 for all pokemon, regardless of species.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because some properties vary by species, and some do not, we want to use inheritance. We now want to create a `Pokemon` superclass that has all functionality that is general to all `Pokemon`, and then we can implement specific species as subclasses afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We now make the `Pokemon` class. Each time a new pokemon is generated, we must draw its individual values randomly. There are three separate stats in the game: `ATK`, `DEF` and `STA`. We implement these as properties."
