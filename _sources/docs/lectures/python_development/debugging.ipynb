    "# Debugging in python\n",
    "\n",
    "Bugs are errors or a flaw in your program that makes the program not behave as expected. Debugging is the processes of finding bugs and resolving them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to quickly resolve bugs if often a skill that differentiate a senior developer from a junior developer. The senior developer has more experience and have a better understanding what might cause a bug, and would therefore know where in the code the bug most likely originates.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this might be true, it is not always the case that the senior developer knows the code base where the bug is, and therefore being able to utilize *debugging tricks* that will speed up the process of finding the bugs are often crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will show you have to use a debugger in python, which is often overseen by junior developers, by if you learn how to use it, it will change the way you debug programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Print statements (logging)\n",
    "The most basic way you can debug your code is to add a bunch of print statements everywhere that will print the state of the program. That way, you are more likely to find the source of the bug more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several drawbacks with this. First of all, the amount of information that is printed might be huge, and therefore being able to filter out the relevant information might be tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another drawback is that, if you manage to track down the bug, you will end up with a lot of print statements all over your code which you will need to remove.\n",
    "However, having the print statements there is also kind of nice in case you encounter a bug in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is of course a very typical situation, and the way you solve this is be implementing a logger, e.g using the [python built in logging module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have a logger you will create a print statement which also contain a logging level. The logging level will typically be `WARNING` which is stuff you really want to know (for example something unexpected happened in your program), `INFO` which is the normal output that should be printed by default and `DEBUG` which will print detailed information which is relevant when tracking down bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run you program you will also specify the logging level which allow you to get more or less information depending on what you want to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using a Debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with a built in debugger called `pdb` which stands fro Python DeBugger. Let us see how we can use it. To illustrate the example we will try to debug the following program which we will write in a file called `debugme.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# debugme.py\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def div(x, y):\n",
    "    return x / y\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def sub(x, n):\n",
    "    return x - n\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def solve(x, y):\n",
    "    y2 = sub(y, 1)\n",
    "    return div(x, y2)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    solve(2, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to run this program you will see the following error message\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python debugme.py\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",

    "Something is going on here, and we will try to use a debugger to find out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Post-mortem debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Post-mortem refers to \"after death\" and post-mortem debugging means that you will start the debugger after the program has crashed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can initiate a post-mortem debugging session by running the script as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python -m pdb debugme.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you execute this command, python will start the debugger (before running your script), and it will throw you into a session that would look something like this\n",

    "\n",
    "You are now inside the debugger. To run the script you can type `c` (or `cont` or `continue`) and you will run the script.\n",

    "## Using an improved Debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "The built in debugger in python is very basic. Therefore, it might be a good idea to upgrade the debugger to a more developer friendly debugger. My recommendation is to use `pdb++`. If you install this debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m pip install pdbpp\n",
    "```\n",
    "python will use this debugger by default. This will add syntax highlighting and tab completion to your debugger which is much nicer to work with."
