    "# Random Number Generators and Seeding\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we will turn to a new topic: generating and using random numbers. In the first lecture on this topic, we will look mainly at generating randomness in our programs. In later lectures we will turn to some examples on how we can use this randomness for different algorithms and scientific problems, and also how we can do testing on stochastic systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomness is important for many scientific applications, and many different problems and algorithms need access to be able to draw elements or samples at random. Also in other parts of programming, randomness can be an important topic. Most games for example, have a considerable component of randomness. Another major field that needs randomness is *cryptography*, which is needed to communicate securely, a crucial component of everything on the internet for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the coming lectures, we will show some examples of using randomness, but for now, we simply state it: randomness is a [valuable commodity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_randomness). We therefore need to know how to generate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some History\n",
    "\n",
    "People have been generating random numbers by mechanical means for millennia, for example by throwing dice, spinning roulette wheels, shuffling cards, and so on. While these techniques might mostly be connected to games and gambling, we can use them to produce randomness for use in scientific studies, statistics and so on as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, sitting at producing your own random numbers by rolling a die is cumbersome and time consuming. To get around this and make the task of producing randomness easier, random number tables would be distributed. These were simply random numbers that were generated, and then tabulated into large tables. As the tables already are random, it doesn't matter how you read these tables, you can go by row, by column, or diagonally for example. But having access to a random number table makes life easier if you need a few random samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "To emphasize the importance of random numbers, you can take a look at the book *A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates*, first published in 1955 by the RAND company. As the name implies, this is a book of a million random digits. The interesting thing however, is that this book was considered quite groundbreaking, as it enabled more people access to a large number of random numbers than ever before.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAND's cooperation's book is an historically important example of the importance of randomness, but it has also seen a new print edition in 2001 with a new foreword. The book has a bunch of humorous [reviews on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Million-Random-Digits-Normal-Deviates/product-reviews/0833030477/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Randomness on Computers\n",
    "\n",
    "With the advent of computers and computing, it was clear that having access to random numbers in a computer program would also be a valuable asset. However, there is an issue, because computers were created to be entirely stable and *deterministic*. There was simply no way for a computer to produce a random number from nothingness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution was to \"import\" random numbers from outside sources. The RAND cooperations book *A million random digits* for example, also came in the format of punch cards, so that they could be read into the computers memory and used by a program. This process was however, very slow, and having access to a sufficient number of sufficiently random numbers was challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where did this randomness that was imported actually come from? These were taken from some physical setup that measured some seemingly random process. *A million random digits* for example, were taken from an electric roulette wheel connected to a large computer that kept spinning the wheel and noting the results. In modern days, many other physical systems for randomness have been proposed and used. Lava lamps have for example been popular, as the movement of the \"lava\" as it moves around and breaks up and merges together can be measured by an electric sensor and seemingly produces random outputs. Other options are looking at radioactive decay with a geiger counter, looking at thermal fluctuations or quantum mechanical noise. These are just some examples, and there are countless more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical means of producing random numbers are still used today, the website [random.org](https://www.random.org/) for example, uses *atmospheric noise* to generate random numbers, the noise is measured by radio and tabulated into random number tables, which is then used when randomness is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pseudorandomness\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are many techniques to measuring physical randomness and using it, there are some problems with these techniques, which we will explain more later. An alternative is to let the computer produce its own random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, earlier, we said that this is problematic, because computers are fully deterministic machines, and this is still true. There is no way for a computer to produce non-deterministic randomness, if it is not connected to some physical RNG. However, in scientific programming, what we care about in our random numbers is the *statistics*. That means, even though they might be deterministic, if we can get the computer to produce numbers that look and behave like random numbers, from a statistical sense, then it will be sufficient for our purposes. We call this *statistically* random numbers. This concept is called [statistical randomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_randomness).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this lecture we will look at examples on how a computer can produce *statistical randomness* that is sufficient for scientific applications. However, it is important to stress that these are completely deterministic processes. To make this clear, another popular term is calling it *pseudorandomness*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any system that produces random numbers is called a *random number generator* or RNG for short. To emphasize that a software-based RNG produces pseudorandom numbers, it is often designated a PRNG/pRNG (pseudorandom number generator).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pseudorandom Number Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "We will noe start looking at how to implement a pRNG on a computer. Now, recall that we cannot generate random numbers out of *nothing*, and so instead, to implement a pRNG, we will implement some rule for taking a number, and producing a new one from the first one. We can then take the second number, and produce a third one, and so one. A pRNG is effectively a *difference* equation that produces a sequence of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, because each number in the sequence i supposed to be statistically random, whatever rule or algorithm we do to find the next number in the sequence should produce a number that should be *uncorrelated* from the previous one. Put simply, each new number in the sequence should \"look\" random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a pRNG effectively just keeps iterating to produce new numbers in a sequence, it needs some starting point. This is called the *seed* of the pRNG, and it is up to us, the user, to supply this seed. We will turn to discuss the seed a bit later, but for now, we simply pick some number.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Middle-Square Method\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first examples of a computer implemented pRNG was proposed by John von Neumann and is called the *middle-square method*. In this method, you find the next number in the sequence by first squaring your number, and then extracting the middle from that result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to start generating such a sequence, we need to start somewhere. Let us say we start with the number\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X_0 = 4096.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now find the next number in the sequence by first squaring:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X_0^2 = 16777216,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and then extracting the middle digits. Because we started with a 4-digit number, we extract the middlemost 4 digits. Meaning the next number in the sequence becomes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X_1 = 7772.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now perform another iteration, note that we now use the previous result as the point to continue from:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X_1^2 = 60403984,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracting the middlemost 4 digits now gives\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X_2 = 4039.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us implement this process in Python:"

    "The middle-square method has some glaring faults, which means it does not work too well as a pRNG in practice. But that is not something we will go into now.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important points is that von Neumann proposed a method for generating sequences of numbers that *looked* random, in a statistical sense, and his method was both easy to implement and very fast. For his purposes, the technique worked well. Compared to reading in random numbers from punch cards, he found that his method was more than a hundred times as fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "After von Neumann, many other pRNGs have been proposed, but they all behave in the same manner: they produce statistically random numbers in a sequence, by performing a set of operations on the previous number in the sequence.\n",

    "### Linear Congruential Generators\n",
    "\n",
    "While the middle-square method was a very original idea, it did not stand the test of time. Another pRNG that did however, which is perhaps even simpler than the middle-square method, are the [linear congruential generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator) (LCGs).\n",
    "\n",
    "LCGs are a whole family of pRGNs that are easy to implement and fast. If they are designed, implemented and used correctly they produce fairly good random numbers, and they have historically been very important and still see some use today. And while they are by no means considered the *best* option out there today, they are still considered good for certain use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned, LCGs are a *family* of generators. They all produce random integers by following the governing  difference equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X_{n+1} = aX_n + c \\mod m.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From this formula, you can see that there are three steps to producing a new number with a LCG:\n",
    "1. Multiply the current number by $a$,  the multiplier\n",
    "2. Add the constant $c$, the increment\n",
    "3. Take the modulo with $m$, the modulus\n",
    "\n",
    "An LCG thus has three adjustable parameters: the multiplier, the increment and the modulus. By defining these three you are deciding on a specific LCG. All three parameters must be integers, and $m$ must be positive, $a$ must be positive and smaller than $m$ and $c$ must be non-negative and smaller than $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call these pRNGs *linear* generator, because this difference equation is a linear equation. Strictly speaking, because of the modulo operator it is a discontinuous, piecewise linear equation. If we set $c=0$ we get a sub-family of LCGs called *multiplicative congruential generator* (MCG).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choice of parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it's important to stress that the parameters $a$, $m$ and $c$ should not be chosen freely, but must be rather carefully selected, if we want to end up with a good pRNG. We'll return to this a bit later and explain what makes a \"good\" choice. For now, we take the parameters given in the book *Numerical Recipes*\n",

    "### Possible Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the LCG we have created spits out a bunch of large integers. And it is at least hard to predict what number comes next. However, to have any use of the numbers that are outputted, we need to at least know the range of possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the next number in the sequence, we multiply the current state by $a=1664525$, and then increment it by $c=1013904223$. Both of these are massive numbers, to we would expect the state of the system to grow by quite a large margin. However, it does not grow beyond all bounds, because the last step is to take the modulo.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X_{n+1} = aX_n + c \\mod m.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the [modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) of a number means finding the remainder after division. It is an important operation in number theory. We won't cover it in detail here, but a nice analogy for the modulo operation is a clock. A normal clock face shows numbers in the range $[0, 12)$, once it goes beyond 12, it starts back at 0. This is effectively a modulo operation. For example, 17:00 on a 24-hour clock would be $17 \\ \\text{mod}\\ 12 = 5$ on a 12-hour clock.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our LCG, we always take the modulo with $m$. This means, just like for the clock, every time our state grows beyond $m$, it \"loops back around. Thus, we are guaranteed that any number output by our LCG will be a number in the range:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$[0, m),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or for our given choice of parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$[0, 2^{32}) = [0, 4294967296).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now. This gives a range for possible values our LCG potentially can output. Are we guaranteed that every single integer in this range can, and will, be output? No, not in general no, but let us assume that this is the case.  The range $[0, 2^{32})$ includes exactly $2^{32}$ integers, so if all possible values in this range are possible, or LCG can then output $2^{32}$ different outcomes. For our LCG to be considered statistically random, we would want all of these outcomes to be equally likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, because we are doing the modulo operation at the end, we can envision our LCG working by spinning the handle of a clock around. Because we multiply $a$ by the previous state $X$, the amount the handle of the clock moves in the next iteration is not a constant length, but dependent on the pseudorandom number $X$. Moving the handle a random amount around the clock gives the next number in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, an interesting question is why we have chosen exactly $m=2^{32}$ as our range. Well, recall that an `int` in C++, and most other programming languages, are precisely 32 bits. As a bit can be either 0 or 1, that means a normal integer in most programming languages can have $2^{32}$ possible values. As we draw non-negative numbers, our LCG produces unsigned integers, but these can be stored in an unsigned int variable, which we define in C++ as `unsigned int`. In other words, by choosing $m=2^{32}$, we are producing exactly one possible 32-bits integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this, it shouldn't come as a surprise that another popular choice for the modulus is $m=2^{64}$, which is the size of a `long` integer in C++ and other programming languages. A benefit of sticking to modulus that are strictly powers of $2^n$ is that computing the modulus is as simple as throwing away the unimportant bits, a process known as *truncating*. This is extremely fast on a computer, much faster than computing the actual modulo, and choosing $m=2^n$ will therefore give a fast LCG.\n",

    "\n",
    "We have now seen how we can use a pRNG to get random outputs of either integers on a range $[0, m)$, or uniformly distributed random floats on the range $[0, 1)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The thing is, our randomly generated numbers can be translated to any such distribution, using different techniques, algorithms or methods. The important thing is that the *randomness* itself is already generated, the remaining steps is just converting how it is understood or interpreted. Because of this, one sometimes talk about producing random numbers simply as producing random *bits*, to make it clear that the randomness produced itself is just information.\n",
    "\n",
    "How uniform random numbers on the interval $[0, 1)$ can be transformed to other distributions, say randomly distributed numbers with a standard deviation of 3.6 and a mean of 4.7, is not a big topic of this course. This is because this is actually a statistical problem, aka, a mathematical problem. However, we do cover one example, just to give you some idea of how it can be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not assume students of IN1910 have taken, or will take, statistics courses. But if you do know some statistics, we can mention that you can generate random numbers from any probability distribution if you know its cumulative distribution function through a process called [inverse transform sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_transform_sampling).\n",

    "\n",
    "If we have uniformly distributed numbers on the range $[0, 1)$, we can easily shift them to any other uniform distribution simply by multiplying and shifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say for example we are interested in the range $[-2, 2)$, we can then first scale the range $[0, 1)$ to $[0, 4)$ by multiplying any sample $X$ by 4: $4x$. Then we shift the whole thing down by 2, so if $X$ is a random number on the range $[0, 1)$, then $4X-2$ is a random number on $[-2, 2)$.\n",
    "\n",

    "### The Box-Muller Algorithm for finding Normally distributed numbers\n",
    "\n",

    "## Seeding and Reproducibility\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that a pRNG needs to start at a given *seed state* to be able to produce a sequence of pseudorandom numbers. It is up to the user of the system to select a seed, and feed it into the pRNG. The choice of the seed will impact what sequence of numbers we get. If we choose a different seed, we get a different sequence out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, because each iteration of the pRNG is a deterministic computation, if we choose the *same seed state*, we get the same exact output. You might have noticed this already, if you execute the same examples in this notebook so far, we get the exact same output, the \"random\" numbers do not change whatsoever, until you change the seed.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the fact that \"random\" numbers do not change on execution, but are 100% determined by the seed might feel like a major flaw of the system. However, recall that the goal is not to produce *true* random numbers, but *statistically* random numbers. The fact that the seed perfectly predicts the outcome is actually a major benefit!\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the same seed produces the same \"random\" sequence, it means that our code is *reproducible* and much easier to test. In fact, this is one of the big reasons pRNGs exist in the first place. Von Neumann developed the middle-square method not only for speed, but also because he found it impossible to test and reproduce his code run with punch cards supplied random numbers. Of course, he could simply write down the sequence the random numbers where supplied into the program in, but the computer did not have close to enough memory to remember all these numbers. With his method however, to reproduce and test the program, you would simply need to remember a single number, the *seed state*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A somewhat silly example of this is the game Minecraft. In Minecraft, the whole world is *procedurally generated*, meaning the world you start in is randomly generated following a set of rules. This means that every game of minecraft should have a completely unique world. However, perhaps you find a really cool world some time, and want to share it with a friend. Well, you would be in luck, because the Minecraft RNG used to randomly generated these worlds is a pRNG, and so if you simply feed in the correct *seed state* to this pRNG, you would end up with the same world. Minecraft uses this intentionally, and for any new world created, you can find the *seed* state of the world, which is basically a long number.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Periodicity of a pRNG\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an interesting consequence of a pRNG being completely deterministic. If you when iterating through and generating a sequence of random numbers, end up at the *same* number, you have effectively returned to your seed state. From this point onwards, your sequence will just repeat the exact same values!\n",

    "Look closely at this sequence. We have seeded our pRNG with the seed value of $6$, when we iterate through and produce new numbers, we eventually end back up at the value 6. From that point onwards, the sequence just repeats itself in exactly the same manner. This is a huge problem, because an important quality of *statistically random* is that numbers are uncorrelated, and we are now getting big correlations in our datasets.\n",

    "The number of values a pRNG produces before it repeats itself is called its *period*. For our example, the period was 6, because it produced six numbers before repeating itself. It's important when we use a pRNG that we do not exhaust its period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, our example LCG was purposefully very simple, to illustrate a short period. But note that while this LCG technically has 9 possible outcomes, because $m=9$, the period is shorter than 9. This is true for any LCG, if our LCG has $m=2^{32}$, then we know that the period is *at most* $2^{32}$. This is again because of the Pigeonhole principle, we simply have to hit a repeated number if we reach $2^{32}+1$ numbers, as we have exhausted all options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for an LCG, the period is at *most* $2^{32}$, but it can be much shorter. And this is were good choices of $a$ and $c$ comes in, as we want to choose values that maximized the period. Note also that the seed also impacts the period. Normally, when we talk about the *period* of a pRNG, we refer to the longest possible period, if we choose the right seed. Seeds that produce cycles of shorter periods than the ideal are often called *bad seed states*. A good pRNG should not really have *bad seed states*, because it is unreasonable to assume our user knows what seeds to avoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this, we see that RANDU is a LCG with $a=65539$, $m=2^{31}$ and $c=0$. As we have seen, these choices of parameters turned out to be bad. To get a better LCG you shouldn't try to choose these parameters yourself, but you should look them up. The [Wikipedia page on LCGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator#Parameters_in_common_use) lists the parameters used by the most commonly used generators today.\n",

    "Now, looking at these numbers. They look to be the same as the ones produced by our Numerical Recipes LCG shown earlier. However, it turns out that IBM choose parameters that were quite bad, and RANDU happens to produce numbers that are very correlated. Quoting [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RANDU):\n",
    "> IBM's RANDU is widely considered to be one of the most ill-conceived random number generators ever designed[2], and was described as \"truly horrible\" by Donald Knuth.[3] It fails the spectral test badly for dimensions greater than 2, and every integer result is odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"spectral test\" in this regard refers to test LCGs, such as randu. If we use our pRNG to draw random points in a unit cube, if our pRNG is behaving as it should, these points will spread out uniformly in the cube, but if there is correlation between the different samples produced by the pRNG, we will see patterns forming in these random points. For most pRNGs we have to move to high dimensions before we can see these patterns, but for RANDU they show up even in 3D.\n",

    "**Figure 2:** (Left) For a \"good\" pRNG, like the one used by `np.random`, we can see no discernible patterns in the random samples, i.e., they are uncorrelated. (Right) RANDU however, fails this test, as we can see the points line up into 15 parallel planes.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of RANDU's creation, not enough diligence was put on verifying its properties. And because of its simplicity and speed, it was quite popular in the 60s and 70s. Because of this, a lot of scientific results that rely on stochastic simulations from that time are seen with skepticism.\n",

    "\n",
    "## State vs Output\n",
    "\n",
    "In all our examples so far, the *state* of the pRNG is simply the previously outputted number. However, there is a problem with this approach, because it means we cannot get *repeated* outcomes. For any truly random sequence, we sometimes expect repeated outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this problem is to create a pRNG that has a larger internal state, and then returns only parts o f that state. For example, an LCG might use a modulus of $m=2^{64}$, meaning the state has 64 bits of information, however, when actually returning the output to the user, they might only use certain parts of this number, such as extracting for example $48$ bits of information. For an LCG, it is common to return the most significant bits in this way, because it can be shown that these bits have a longer period than the lower bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "By only returning parts of the state, we ensure that we can actually get the same output multiple times, without the state being the same and producing a low period.\n",
    "\n",
    "A test of a pRNG testing this is called *the birthday test*, because it is based on the [Birthday problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem). The Birthday problem is as follows: In a room of $n$ people, what is the chance that at least two people share the same birthday? Assuming that the birthdays of people in the room are random, it effectively asks the chance of drawing the same random sample from a distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Birthday problem has the surprising answer that with only 23 people in the room, there is a bigger than 50% chance that two people share a birthday, and that increases to a staggering 99.9% with just 70 people! By generalizing the problem, we can test wether an RNG gives us the expected number of repeated samples for a given distributions. Many simpler pRNGs fail the birthday test.\n",

They are still seen quite a bit, but they are considered a bit out-dated. Wikipedia's article on LCGs has a [table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator#Parameters_in_common_use) showing commonly used LCGs today, and you can see that it is for example, still used in Java.\n",

    "\n",
    "Mersenne primes are primes that can be written on the form $2^n-1$. Note that this expression is *not* prime for all $n$, but for some $n$, it is, and those are the Mersenne primes. Mersenne primes are interesting in mathematics, because it turns out that they have an important connection to *perfect* numbers. Because of this, people are searching hard to find every larger Mersenne primes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The currently know largest prime is a Mersenne prime, specifically it is\n",

    "$$2^{77,232,917} − 1,$$\n",

    "which is a number with 23,249,425 digits. This happens to also be the largest prime known altogether. In fact, out of the 10 largest primes known, 9 of them are Mersenne primes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the largest Mersenne primes are found by a collaboration known as the [Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search](https://www.mersenne.org/) (GIMPS), which is a group of volunteers running the GIMPS software on their normal desktop computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Electronic Frontier Foundation has traditionally given out large cash prizes to whoever breaks a big milestone, such as the first prime to pass one million, and ten million digits. The next prize is $150,000 to whoever finds the first prime with 100 million digits or more. It wouldn't be unreasonable to assume the GIMPS will be the first to find this number.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Mersenne twister algorithm is called *Mersenne* because it uses a specific Mersenne prime as its basis. This could in theory by any Mersenne prime, but the most commonly used version uses the Mersenne prime\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2^{19937}-1,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and it is sometimes referred to as Mersenne Twister 19937 for this reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"twister\" part of the name comes from the fact that this algorithm is *blazingly* fast. And this name is not really an exaggeration, it is one of the fastest algorithms for drawing random numbers out there.\n",

    "$$2^{19937}-1,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is an amazingly large number. This means that there is no chance of hitting repeated cycles for any real application of the Mersenne Twister.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mersenne Twister algorithm was first published in 1997 by Makoto Matsumoto Takuji Nishimura. At that time it was definitely the best pRNG available. Over time the algorithm has been slightly been improved, but it is still  considered the gold standard. While some other options have become available, the Mersenne Twister is still a very good choice for most scientific programming applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Precisely because of its great qualities, the Mersenne twister is the pRNG of choice for most software purposes, and it is for example the one you use when you use `random` or `np.random` in Python. It is also available from the standard library in C++. While we won't cover how the Mersenne twister works, you should know about it, because it is what you will most likely end up using a lot in the future.\n",

    "## A note on Cryptographic Security\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Mersenne twister is a very good pRNG, it is not at all suited for *cryptographic* use cases. While you can freely use Mersenne twister for scientific programming or games, you should *not* use it for security purposes. In Python for example, starting with 3.6, there is a fully separate package used to produce more secure random numbers called `secrets`, which should be used instead of random.\n",

    "## Generating Random Numbers in C++\n",
    "\n",
    "When we start to use random numbers in the coming lectures, we will mostly stick with Python. However, we would like to take a few minutes to show you how to generate random numbers in your C++ programs as well, because there are some easy traps you can walk straight into. We first cover the \"wrong\" way to do things, this is the same way as in C, and the \"old\" C++ way. Then we cover the \"proper\" way to do things, which is available since C++11.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"Old\" or \"Wrong\" way to do things\n",
    "\n",
    "In C and C++, there is a built in function called simply `rand()`. This underlying pRNG that is used relies on your compiler, but in most cases, it is a LCG, though with different parameters for different compilers.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call it as a function with no input. The following complete C++ program prints out 5 consecutive integers from the pRNG:\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "#include <iostream>\n",
    "\n",
    "int main() {\n",
    "    for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {\n",
    "        cout << rand() << endl;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    return 0;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you run the program several times, you will notice that the output is exactly the same. This is because if no seed is explicitly given, it will seed with the value `1`. And so each run of the program will therefore be identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can explicitly seed your program with the built-in function `srand` (for \"seed rand\"). If you *do* want your program to behave differently each run,  a common way to do it is to use `time`, which gives you the current time in seconds. Running a program a few seconds apart will then give a different seed, and thus a different sequence:\n",
    "***\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "srand(time(nullptr));\n",
    "\n",
    "for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {\n",
    "    cout << rand() << endl;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "To translate the numbers made by `rand()` to useable numbers, we need to know the range of the pRNG. This is defined in the built-in variable `RAND_MAX`, which specifies the biggest integer we can get out, so to get random floats in the range $[0, 1)$, we need to divide by `RAND_MAX + 1`. we should also cast it to a double, otherwise we get integer division and most likely an overflow error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Script that prints out 5 random floats:\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, why do we call this the \"wrong\" way of doing things? Well, the C++ standard gives few guarantees for how good the underlying pRNG is, or about it's period. The only requirement from the C++ standard is that it should output at least 32 thousand numbers. A scientific application can easily exhaust this, and so using the built in `rand` would completely ruin the program. In addition, the `rand` function is an LCG, which is sort of outdated and not considered great.\n",

    "### The \"proper\" way of generating random numbers in C++\n",

    "\n",
    "First of, the `<random>` header splits up the underlying pRNG *engine*, and the random number distribution itself. So if we want to create random numbers, we should first specify what pRNG to use. We recommend sticking with the `mt19937` engine, its constructor only takes the seed as the input:\n",

    "Here we again make our engine object. Next we make our distribution object. The constructor for the `uniform_real_distribution` takes the ends of the range, so we send in 0 and 1.

We need both to produce our samples, so we call it with `uniform(engine)` (these are the two names I chose for my two objects, you can choose other names).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for any given program we should only ever create and use a single engine (unless we are parallel programming, in which case each thread should have its own engine). But we can make several distribution objects, and use them with the same engine. So say your program needs floats on the range 0 to 1, integers between 0 and 1999 and normally distributed numbers with a standard deviation of 3, we would set up our engine and distributions as follows\n",
