    "# Solving the 1D Diffusion Equation using Finite Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Random Walks](random_walks_and_markov_processes.md) we looked at random walks, and we finished that lecture by showing how we can go from a discrete problem to a continuous partial differential equation called the Diffusion Equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}\\nabla^2 c.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will briefly look at how we can solve this equation numerically, and look at some solutions with different initial conditions and different boundary conditions. Most of the material here is presented as supplementary material, and is not considered part of IN1910's curriculum.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Solving the Diffusion Equation using Finite Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "A popular strategy for solving both ODEs and PDEs is discretizing them so that we only solve them at regular intervals, which we call *mesh points*. We can then approximate the derivatives with 'finite' differences, as opposed to the infinitesimal limit they actually represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, this process is called *discretizing* the continuous differential equations. Somewhat ironic is it that this is the exact opposite process of what we did to find our PDE in the first place!\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote the solution we are looking for by $c(x,t)$, because it can be seen as the *concentration* of some particles at a given location $x$ at time $t$. For example the concentration of oxygen in a room.\n",
    "\n",
    "We discretize using a given step length $\\Delta x$ in space, and a given time step $\\Delta t$ in time, thus we will only solve for the concentration at points\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c(x_i, t_j), \\qquad x_i \\equiv i\\cdot \\Delta x, \\qquad t_j = j\\cdot \\Delta t,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $i$ and $j$ are integers. To simplify writing, we define the shorthand\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c_{i, j} \\equiv c(x_i, t_j).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now start to approximate the derivatives. This can be done in many ways, but the most straight forward is using only the first terms of the Taylor series. This leads to the expression we found in L19\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{c_{i, j+1} - c_{i, j}}{\\Delta t} = D\\frac{c_{i+1, j} - 2 c_{i, j} + c_{i-1, j}}{\\Delta x^2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note however, that here we use a 1. order finite difference approximation in time, but a 2. order finite difference order in space. This means we should pick $\\Delta t \\leq \\Delta x.$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approximating the spatial derivative\n",
    "\n",
    "For the spatial derivative, we use a 2. order central difference approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bigg(\\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg)_{i, j} \\approx \\frac{c_{i+1, j} - 2 c_{i, j} + c_{i-1, j}}{\\Delta x^2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is again found from truncating the Taylor series, but this time the error is $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^2)$, meaning the solver will be a bit more forgiving to the second-order spatial step length, compared to the first-order time step. This means we should pick $\\Delta t < \\Delta x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding our computational stencil\n",
    "\n",
    "Our numerical expression is now\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{c_{i, j+1} - c_{i, j}}{\\Delta t} = D\\frac{c_{i+1, j} - 2 c_{i, j} + c_{i-1, j}}{\\Delta x^2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can massage this expression even further. By shuffling around some terms, we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c_{i, j+1} = c_{i, j} + D\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2}\\big(c_{i+1, j} - 2 c_{i, j} + c_{i-1, j}\\big).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that $D$, $\\Delta t$ and $\\Delta x$ are all constants, and so we can also introduce a new constant to simplify further:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha \\equiv D\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which gives us the equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c_{i, j+1} = c_{i, j} + \\alpha\\big(c_{i+1, j} - 2 c_{i, j} + c_{i-1, j}\\big),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c_{i, j+1} = \\alpha c_{i+1, j} - (1 - 2\\alpha) c_{i, j} + \\alpha c_{i-1, j}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Such an equation is sometimes shown as a *computational stencil*\n",
    "\n",
    "```{figure} ../../figures/computational_stencil.png\n",
    "---\n",
    "width: 500px\n",
    "name: computational_stencil\n",
    "alt: computational_stencil\n",
    "---\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the equation or the stencil, we see that we compute the concentration at the 'next' time step $t_{j+1}$, based on the values at the 'current' time step $t_j$, based on the three closest points in space $x_{i-1}$, $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explicit vs Implicit\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that our computational stencil only involves a single 'next' time step, we call this an *explicit* scheme, as it explicitly states how to compute the new values. The opposite would be an implicit scheme, where for each time step the solver must solve a set of equations algebraically to find the new values. Simply put, explicit schemes are a lot easier to implement and solve. The downside is that explicit schemes can sometimes be unstable, and we need to be a bit more careful with our computational resolution and such with explicit schemes. Some implicit schemes, such as the *backward* Euler scheme, are much more stable, and can handle a wider variety of parameters and resolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling the boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the stencil, we notice there will be an issue at the boundaries of the domain. To calculate the point at the edge of the boundary, $u_{0, j+1}$, we need to know $u_{-1, j+1}$, which doesn't exist! To get around this problem, we need to specify boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest boundary conditions are the *Dirichlet* conditions, also known as a concentration clamp. This simply forces the solution to have certain values at the boundary, and thus, we don't need to actually compute them, we can just set them to their clamped values: $u(0, t) = u_0$ and $u(L, t) = u_L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other common form of boundary conditions are the *Neumann* conditions. With these, it is the flux over the boundary that is clamped, and not the concentration itself. Most commonly, the flux is set to 0, meaning no concentration can every cross the boundary. This specific condition is often referred to as a 'no-flow' or 'reflective' boundary. To implement this condition, we pretend that that the points immediately outside the boundary, such as $u_{-1, j}$ exists, and set these imaginary 'ghost points' equal to the value at the boundary. As a diffusion flux is driven by a concentration difference, by setting $u_{-1,j} = u_{0,j}$, the math itself will make sure no flux occurs across the boundary.\n",

    "## System 2 - Transport across the synaptic cleft\n",
    "\n",
    "For our second system, we will look at the diffusive transport of neurotransmitters across a synapse. When a signal is to be sent from one neuron to another, an action potential in the pre-synaptic membrane causes the release of neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft between the cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "To model this system, we assume the concentration to be zero initially. At time $t=0$ the pre-synaptic side, which we place on the left, starts releasing neurotransmitters. For simplicity sake, we implement this as a concentration clamp $u(0, t) = C$, which can be thought of as the release of neurotransmitters as being some sort of equilibrium process. At the other side of the synapse, the neurotransmitters will be absorbed. Let us assume, again for simplicity, that this absorption occurs so rapidly that we can assume there is never any unabsorbed neurotransmitters at this point. This means we can use another concentration clamp of $u(L, t)=0$."
