    "This information about the types are known when the program runs, i.e at runtime. In many other programming languages, such as C++, we need to know this information before the program run, i.e at compile time. Such languages typically use a compiler to translate the source code (i.e the code you write) into machine instructions which is stored in some binary file that you can run. Languages where you need to specify the type before the program runs are called statically typed languages. Static here refers to that once you have declared a variable to have a certain type then it is in general not allowed to change the type. In python, on the other hand there is nothing preventing you from doing this. For example the following code runs without problem"
