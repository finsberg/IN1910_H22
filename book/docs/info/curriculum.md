# Curriculum

The lecture notes and the four mandatory projects are the curriculum of IN1910.

## Curriculum and Teaching Materials

We do not operate with a single book in IN1910, as we are covering many different topics that are not well covered by any existing textbook. The curriculum is therefore defined by what is covered in the lectures. For each lecture, there will be accompanying lecture notes covering that week's material. If you are not attending the lectures, you should read/work through the lecture notes. If you do attend lectures, it might be a good idea to skim through the lecture notes before any given lecture, or go through them at your own pace after a given lesson.

In addition to the lecture notes, we will give references to external teaching materials that you can use to better learn the materials. These are meant as additional information to those who want it, or alternatives to those who might not like the style or tone of the lecture notes. Note that these secondary materials are just recommendations, and you can choose which of them to use or cover yourself. Most of the materials we recommend will be open source materials freely available online.

As a good reference on Python for scientific programming, we recommend *A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python, Fifth Edition av Hans Petter Langtangen*, which many of you taking the course probably already have already. If you do not, you are not required to acquire it.

IN1900 is using a new book this semester called [*Introduction to Scientific Programming with Python*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-030-50356-7) written by Joakim Sundnes which is a free e-book that can also by used in addition.

Finally the book *Programming for Computations - Python
A Gentle Introduction to Numerical Simulations with Python 3.6* is another good alternative which is also [freely available as an e-book](https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/23103).

## Accessing Teaching Materials

All teaching materials are shared on a git repository on the UiO Github server. You will need to log in with your UiO username and password. You will soon learn how to use Git repositories.
The teaching material are published using something called GitHub pages which you can access go going to the following link:

* https://pages.github.uio.no/IN1910/IN1910_H22

These lecture notes are generated from Jupyter notebooks which you can find here

* [https://github.uio.no/IN1910/IN1910](https://github.uio.no/IN1910/IN1910).

These notebooks contain working code examples and we encourage you to try changed the code in order to see how this will alter the output. You can download these notebooks through git to your own machine and run them through Jupyter, or you can use the UiO Jupyterhub server. Here you will also log in with your UiO username and password, and you can then navigate to IN1910. When you run Jupyter notebooks through Jupyterhub, you are running things on a UiO server, so this is a good solution for reading materials if you are on a different computer than your regular computer with everything installed.

## Alternative resources

In addition to the lecture notes we recommend using the book [A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python](https://hplgit.github.io/primer.html/doc/pub/half/book.pdf) by Hans Petter Langtangen, as well as [_Introduction to Scientific Programming with Python_](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-030-50356-7) written by Joakim Sundnes which will be used in IN1900 this semester and [Programming for Computations](https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/23103).

There are also a lot of good resources online, including

On YouTube I would also recommend watching a [tutorial series on how to set up a python development environment](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTt66h8cVpmbayBKlMTuS55y), and also the [Python beginner tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7) by the same author.
