# Project Work, Grading and Exam

## Projects

There will be handed out four projects during the semesters. You will need to do Project 0 alone, while Project 1-3 can be done individually, or in pairs. A total of 100 points can be collected in total. 10 points can be collected at the first project, while the remaining projects all give maximum 30 points. You need to get at least 60% correct on each project to qualify for the final oral exam. If you fail a project, but get at least 30% on it, we will give you a chance to improve your submission.

**Applying for extensions:** Please note that because all the projects are considered part of the basis of the course grade, you must apply for extensions on any mandatory work if required. You can do this directly to the administration at [studieinfo@ifi.uio.no](mailto:studieinfo@ifi.uio.no). Please apply for extensions as soon as you are aware you need it, and before the deadline has expired if at all possible.

**Course Grade:** Note that in this course you will only get a Pass/Fail grade. However you can, after completing the course, request a diploma which will state how many points your were able to get.

**Working in pairs:** For Projects 1-3 you can work in pairs if you want. For each of these projects we will set up a nettskjema a head of time which you can fill in if you either want to work alone, or if you have a specific partner you want to work with. Anyone who does not fill out the nettskjema will be assigned a random partner for the project.

## Exam

You need to pass all four projects in the course to qualify for the final oral exam. The final oral exam is a Pass/Fail grade, and must be passed to pass the course as a whole. The oral exam is individual and will focus mainly on the project work in the course. You will be asked to present your work from one of projects (chosen randomly). In addition you will get a few questions from the other projects and the remaining curriculum. Note that even if you do project work in pairs, you will need to be able to answer questions regarding all parts of your submission.
