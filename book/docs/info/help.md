# Getting help or giving feedback

## Mattermost
We plan to use Mattermost in IN1910, which is a digital collaboration platform. You can use Mattermost to chat with the lecturer, the teaching assistants/gruppelærere and other students. You can access Mattermost at the following link (you can log in with your normal UiO username and password). Note that you should have been added to the IN1910 group in Mattermost automatically

## Feedback from Students

If you have any comments, thoughts, criticisms or suggestions, please do not hesitate to let us know! You can contact the lecturer directly, in person or by email (henriknf@simula.no, TBW). You can also let your TA/gruppelærer know, so they can bring it along. For complaints of a serious nature, or if you want to remain anonymous, we recommend you contact the administration at IFI directly, or get in touch with one of the student unions:
* [Fagutvalget ved Institutt for informatikk](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/livet-rundt-studiene/organisasjoner/fui.html)
* [Matematisk Fagutvalg](https://www.mn.uio.no/math/livet-rundt-studiene/studentdemokrati/matematisk-fagutvalg/)
